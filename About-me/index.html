          Dr. Pankaj Kumar Tiwari is an Assistant Professor at the Department of
          Basic Science and Humanities, Indian Institute of Information
          Technology, Bhagalpur. Originally from Siwan, Bihar, India, he holds a
          B.Sc. degree in Mathematics from Magadh University, Boadh Gaya. He
          received M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from the Banaras Hindu
          University, Varanasi. He received a Ph.D. degree in November, 2015
          from the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. In his doctoral thesis,
          he studied water pollution and eutrophication in water bodies. The
          work included the possible control measures of water pollution and
          eutrophication. He received several scholarships and fellowships
          (UGC-JRF, GATE, NBHM and DS Kothari postdoc fellowships) from the
          Government of India and WWS2 post doc fellowship from the Italian
          Government. After completing his doctoral dissertation, he studied
          respiratory diseases and dengue disease transmission through
          mathematical and statistical modeling frameworks. He is actively
          working on mathematical modeling of ecological, epidemiological and
          eco-epidemiological problems.
